# Overview

The problem: <br>
Students often spend more time than they need on their homework and don’t learn the material as effectively as they could, because they study alone and do not leverage the power of face-to-face study groups with peer mentors.

The solution: <br>
Ohana Scholars would allow UH students to create and join study groups around an academic topic.

# Approach
In order to access features of Ohana Scholars, a student must login and set up their profile. Creating a profile will allow the student to add courses and subjects they may need help with or wish to help others. The student profiles will require their name and a headshot so that others may recognize them easily. Profiles may include other contact information so that students may contact them more privately.

Another section of the site lists all of subjects. Within each course, it is possible to see the students. Students can propose a study session around a topic currently being covered in their course (for example, “Write my essay on configuration management”, and a time to meet within ICSpace (i.e. 8:30-9:30pm tonight)). This proposal generates a notification to all of the students, and they can respond by saying they intend to come at some point during the time period.

There is an online calendar that shows all of the study sessions and who is attending.

There are two styles of use for Ohana Scholars:
<ol>
    <li>
        You want to plan a session for some time in the future. In this case, you schedule the time period and others can view it and plan accordingly should they be interested.
    </li>
    <li>
        Sometimes you might realize you need help as soon as possible. In this case, you can attempt to schedule a session ASAP. This sends out an notification to all the other students in that subject that a session has been requested, and hopefully a group will spontaneously form.
    </li>
</ol>
Ohana Scholars seems great in theory, but there is a significant barrier to adoption: students are naturally inhibited about asking for or offering help. This might be overcome through the use of well designed game mechanics.

Part of the design of Ohana Scholars should be some kind of point system, or “levels”, or some other game mechanic to reward students for participating.

In addition, Ohana Scholars has a reputation system. This is to rate students based on how helpful and respectful they were.

There must also be admins who monitor the site and who users can contact if they suspect inappropriate behavior. The admins would also be able to add subjects by request of users if the subject's category does not already exist.

Important design goals for Ohana Scholars are:
<ul>
    <li>To encourage use of sessions among students</li>
    <li>To minimize risk of inappropriate encounters by requiring all meetings to occur in ICSpace.</li>
    <li>To encourage face-to-face interaction among students.</li>
    <li>Everyone passes!</li>
</ul>
There are other mechanisms (Slack, Discord) for asynchronous, online help and support. Ohana Scholars is designed to facilitate live, real-world help using sessions.

    <li>Admin goes to landing page, logs in, gets home page, edits sites/courses.</li>
    <li>User goes to landing page, logs in, checks existing study sessions, requests new session if not applicable</li>
    <li>User is notified of new sessions, joins or ignores.</li>
    <li>User checks their reputation based on ratings</li>
    <li>User checks their emails and can reply or write new ones</li>
    
</ul>

# Beyond the Basics

After implementing the basic functionality, here are ideas for more advanced features:

<ul>
    <li>Text message interface. See notifications, and reply to confirm attendance all through text message.</li>
    <li>Discord integration to facilitate notification and organization of meetings.</li>
    <li>A Discord Bot to suggest and help implement Ohana Scholars meetings.</li>
    <li>A rating system for students participation.</li>
</ul>
