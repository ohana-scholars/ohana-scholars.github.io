# Overview

The problem: <br>
Students often spend more time than they need on their homework and don’t learn the material as effectively as they could, because they study alone and do not leverage the power of face-to-face study groups with peer mentors.

The solution: <br>
Ohana Scholars would allow UH students to create and join study groups around an academic topic.

# Approach
In order to access features of Ohana Scholars, a student must login and set up their profile. Creating a profile will allow the student to add courses and subjects they may need help with or wish to help others. The student profiles will require their name and a headshot so that others may recognize them easily. Profiles may include other contact information so that students may contact them more privately.

Another section of the site lists all of the ICS courses. Within each course, it is possible to see the grasshoppers and the senseis. A grasshopper can propose a study session around a topic currently being covered in their course (for example, “Write my essay on configuration management”, and a time to meet within ICSpace (i.e. 8:30-9:30pm tonight)). This proposal generates a notification to all of the grasshoppers and senseis, and they can respond by saying they intend to come at some point during the time period.

There is an online calendar that shows all of the study sessions and who is attending.

There are two styles of use for Ohana Scholars:
<ol>
    <li>
        You want to plan a group study session for later in the day or some subsequent day. In that case, you schedule the time period for sometime in the future.
    </li>
    <li>
        You are having a problem right now. In that case, you can go into Study Buddy and schedule the session for “Right Now!”. This indicates you are right now in ICSpace and need help. All the other sensei and grasshoppers for that course will be notified, and hopefully a group will spontaneously form in a few minutes.
    </li>
</ol>
Study Buddy seems great in theory, but there is a significant barrier to adoption: students are naturally inhibited about asking for or offering help. This might be overcome through the use of well designed game mechanics.

Part of the design of Study Buddy should be some kind of point system, or “levels”, or some other game mechanic to reward students for participating.

In addition, you can solicit gift cards or other kinds of rewards from the ICS Department or UH Manoa to reward the “best” sensei and grasshoppers in a given week, month, or semester. The challenge is to design the point system so that students cannot “game” the system to obtain points without actually helping others. You also want to prevent a “hui” of students from simply pretending to work together to get the most points and then split the prize without actually helping each other.

There must also be admins who monitor the site and who users can contact if they suspect inappropriate behavior.

Important design goals for Study Buddy are:
<ul>
    <li>To encourage use of ICSpace among ICS students</li>
    <li>To minimize risk of inappropriate encounters by requiring all meetings to occur in ICSpace.</li>
    <li>To encourage face-to-face interaction among ICS students.</li>
</ul>
There are other mechanisms (Slack, Piazza) for asynchronous, online help and support. Study Buddy is designed to facilitate live, real-world help using ICSpace.

Note: if you choose this idea for your final project, you cannot name it “Study Buddy”. Come up with a different name for your final project.

# Mockup Page Ideas

Some possible mockup pages include:
<ul>
    <li>Landing page</li>
    <li>User home page</li>
    <li>Admin home page</li>
    <li>User profile page</li>
    <li>Create Sessions page</li>
    <li>Create user page</li>
    <li>Edit user page</li>
    <li>View sessions page</li>
    <li>Calendar Page</li>
    <li>Rate student page</li>
    <li>Chatroom page</li>
</ul>

# Use Case Ideas

Whether or not the following bullet points list all pages or not, the completed use case should show an end-to-end scenario of using the system.

<ul>
    <li>New user goes to landing page, creates new profile, gets home page, may edit profile</li>
    <li>Admin goes to landing page, logs in, gets home page, edits sites/courses.</li>
    <li>User goes to landing page, logs in, checks existing study sessions, requests new session if not applicable</li>
    <li>User is notified of new sessions, joins or ignores.</li>
    <li>User checks their reputation based on ratings</li>
</ul>

# Beyond the Basics

After implementing the basic functionality, here are ideas for more advanced features:

<ul>
    <li>Text message interface. See notifications, and reply to confirm attendance all through text message.</li>
    <li>Slack integration to facilitate notification and organization of meetings.</li>
    <li>A Slack Bot to suggest and help implement Study Buddy meetings.</li>
    <li>A rating system for meetings and sensei participation.</li>
</ul>
