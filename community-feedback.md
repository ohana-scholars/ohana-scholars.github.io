### Venus
_The website has a clean and organized layout, which is easy to navigate. The website's color scheme is also charming and has a good balance of white space. The design is simple and clean, making it easy to navigate. The typography is straightforward, and using different font sizes helps create a clear information hierarchy. The content on the website is informative and well-written. The language is easy to understand, and the information is presented clearly and concisely. The website adjusts well to different screen sizes. All the links and buttons on the website are functional and lead to the appropriate pages. The website loads quickly, and the navigation is straightforward._

_3/5 - Good website, love the layout and the fluidity of the webpage. Everything is easy to understand and accessible. Creating a new session is very simple, although it is very confusing when the textbox shows a checkmark but gives you an error. Many of the textboxes don’t have limits on them, so be careful when you set them up. Images are nonexistent, can only type in the image instead of uploading the file which makes no sense. Finding sessions is easy when you filter by classes, but can be confused since it isn’t sorted by time and date. You can infinitely join any session without limit, making the webpage very long and hard to scroll. I would recommend showing the number of users joined or the first few names that joined. The Courses list is very nice, although I would like to have filtered sessions for the class when I click the “View” sessions button instead of taking me back to the general sessions page. I also don’t like that when you rate a profile, it shows that the rating is valid (like -1 or a decimal) but gives an error. Very counterintuitive. Overall, good idea but a lot of work needs to be done._

_The overall aesthetic, design, and functionality of this website is very pleasant and straightforward to use. All the icons are laid out neatly and clearly so that the user can easily access them and to know what they are doing. I also appreciate the organization website being a separate entity to look at instead of combining it into one place. Creating and viewing different study sessions is very simple, my only suggestion would be to have filters for time/place so that it's easier to find specific groups. Another small thing is to perhaps change the image link to a drag/drop feature instead so that it is easier to customize sessions/profiles. It would also be cool if sessions could be color-coded for organization. In general, a great website!_
